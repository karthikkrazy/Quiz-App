# Quizapp

This is a Flutter app that presents a quiz with multiple-choice questions to the user. The user is given a limited amount of time to answer each question, and if they answer correctly, they earn a point. After all questions have been answered, the app displays the user's score and gives them the option to restart the quiz.
